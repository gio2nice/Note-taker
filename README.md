# Note Taker Starter Code

This application was made with Express js and deployed using Heroku. It was tested locally before starting the steps to deploy the final product on Heroku. Notetaker is a simple notetaking application. When the user first enters the initial page, you see a button that says get started. When I click on the button, it takes me to the notes page, where a user can create, read, update and delete notes. 

## How to Run app

To run this application locally, navigate to the server.js file and open it in the integrated terminal. Start by running NPM I to install all dependecies needed then node server.js. A message will be received saying that the server is being listened to on port 3304. In your browser, type http://localhost:3304/. The view from the browser should show the application on your local machine.
